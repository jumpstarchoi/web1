The Chinese government plans to reopen talks with 10 Southeast Asian nations on a code of conduct for the South China Sea, political experts say.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in August that talks on the South China Sea should reopen, state-controlled news media in China reported.
Wang also said at a meeting in Beijing this month that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations should try to finish the code “at a faster pace,” China Central Television reported on its website.
In July, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said that Chinese territorial claims in the sea are illegal. Pompeo also said the United States would help other countries that have disputes with the Chinese government over the sea.
The Chinese government claims about 90 percent of the 3.5 million-square-kilometer sea. However, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam also have claims.
